For the past 4 years I've been building a career in an industry that makes me wake up every day excited about it.

As digital is now leading the way, I entered the web challenge focused on staying ahead of the game and up to date about marketing, design e social media trends.

Without a degree in computer science, I work closely with developers, designers, operations and usability experts. That makes me a *non-technical* product manager who is in between marketing and sales (aka the money makers) and engineering. I'm the person who can inspire tech people and make them see that what they're working on matters, to both customer and business.

Confidence comes from passion, from victories and, most of all, from a deep understanding of customers, product and team. Nowadays, I have confidence on my multidisciplinary approach and pride myself on my ability to create any product from the ground up. Nearly 4 years of *hands-on* experience allow me to take products from idea, to execution and promotion. 

Product management is always an apprenticeship because you have to work with many different areas. You must know the customer, market, and business better than anyone else. Therefore, I'm always looking forward to improving my *know-how*, new ideas and best practices.

Finally, I am very passionate about food and I have a personal project as a foodblogger on [degostar.pt](http://degostar.pt).
